    "Understanding the level of measurement in data analysis is like using the right tool for the job. If you have a nominal variable, like colors, you wouldn't try to calculate an average because colors can't be added or subtracted. Similarly, if you have a ratio variable, like height in centimeters, you can calculate a meaningful average because zero represents the absence of height. It's about choosing the right analysis method for the type of data you have to get accurate results.\n",

    "Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain\n",
    "how each measure can be used to describe a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Common measures of central tendency include the mean, median, and mode. The mean is the average value of a dataset and provides a measure of the center. The median is the middle value when the dataset is ordered, and it is less affected by extreme values, making it useful for skewed distributions. The mode is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of variability include the range, standard deviation, and variance. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset and gives an indication of the spread of the data. The standard deviation measures the average distance of data points from the mean, providing information about the dispersion of the data. The variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean and is another measure of data spread. These measures help to understand how much the data values deviate from the central tendency, providing insights into the variability of the dataset."
